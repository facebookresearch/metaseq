# Metaseq
A codebase for working with [Open Pre-trained Transformers](projects/OPT).


## Community Integrations

### Using OPT with ðŸ¤— Transformers

The OPT 125M--66B models are now available in [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/releases/tag/v4.19.0). You can access them under the `facebook` organization on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/facebook)

### Using OPT-175B with Alpa

The OPT 125M--175B models are now supported in the [Alpa project](https://alpa-projects.github.io/tutorials/opt_serving.html), which 
enables serving OPT-175B with more flexible parallelisms on older generations of GPUs, such as 40GB A100, V100, T4, M60, etc.

### Using OPT with Colossal-AI

The OPT models are now supported in the [Colossal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI#OPT), which helps users to efficiently and quickly deploy OPT models training and inference, reducing large AI model budgets and scaling down the labor cost of learning and deployment.
