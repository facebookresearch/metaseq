class IncrementalDecoder(BaseDecoder):
    """Base class for incremental decoders.

    Incremental decoding is a special mode at inference time where the Model
    only receives a single timestep of input corresponding to the previous
    output token (for teacher forcing) and must produce the next output
    *incrementally*. Thus the model must cache any long-term state that is
    needed about the sequence, e.g., hidden states, convolutional states, etc.

    Compared to the standard :class:`BaseDecoder` interface, the incremental
    decoder interface allows :func:`forward` functions to take an extra keyword
    argument (*incremental_state*) that can be used to cache state across
    time-steps.

    The :class:`IncrementalDecoder` interface also defines the
    :func:`reorder_incremental_state` method, which is used during beam search
    to select and reorder the incremental state based on the selection of beams.

    To learn more about how incremental decoding works, refer to `this blog
    <http://www.telesens.co/2019/04/21/understanding-incremental-decoding-in-fairseq/>`_.

    Note that incremental_state will take different values depending on the
    situation. At train and validation time, incremental_state will be None,
    indicating that no incremental state is available and does not need to be
    computed.

    During generation, incremental_state will begin as an empty
    dictionary, indicating no incremental_state is available, but SHOULD be
    computed. This class modifies this dictionary inline via
    reorder_incremental_state. After that first initial step, incremental_state
    will be full of model-specific state.
